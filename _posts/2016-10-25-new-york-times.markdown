[I was recently featured in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/us/pentagon-artificial-intelligence-terminator.html) in relation to a [DARPA](http://www.darpa.mil/) project I am working on. For this project, I use a combination of COTS components and custom hardware I design and manufacture to produce small autonomous air vehicles capable of carrying specific sensors. I also pilot the vehicles for tests, data collects, and demonstrations.
