title: Printing a Drone on the Mark X
description: On October 4th, 2016, Markforged launched a new 3D printer, the Mark X. In an effort to highlight the increased build volume of this machine in comparison with the Mark 2, I designed a drone chassis that could be printed in one piece on the Mark X. I designed the vehicle to use only 3DR IRIS+ components; the motors, propellers, flight, controller, and battery all came from an IRIS. An afternoon of CADing and a day of printing later, I had a new drone. This first version flew relatively well, though I did not make space for a GPS module or an external magnetometer. This limits the functionality of the vehicle, but I will be addressing this shortcoming in new revisions.
