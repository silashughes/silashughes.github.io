description: I've struggled with publically documenting my projects for a long time. Over the years, I've tried wikis, blogs, site builders, social media, and nothing has stuck. Each site either required too much time and effort to update reguarly or became so convoluted it stopped being a medium I wanted to use for documentation. So this is my latest attempt, refined with a couple lessons learned. This is a simple website I've put together from a couple templates and little coding duct tape, but I think it will be stable enough to serve it's purpose. As I complete small projects or reach milestons on larger projects, I will post one photo and a short description of the what I did and what I learned. I'll also be going back through previous projects and make posts for them as well. The goal is not to tell the whole story, just to enough to interesting to others and to remind me as the years go by.
