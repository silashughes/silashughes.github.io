I have been designing and building small air vehicles of all shapes and types since 2010. From [building drones to catch whale snot](https://shop.whale.org/pages/snotbot) to designing a [quadcopter chassis that can be printed in one piece](https://markforged.com/mark-x-application-unibody-3d-printed-drone/), I have built many odd flying machines. I continue to build these machines for professional and recreational purposes.
