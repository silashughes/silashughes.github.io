I have BS in Mechanical Engineering with a focus in Robotics from [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu/), and much of my experience there was based in the [Intelligent Vehicle Lab](http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/robotics/). For my senior capstone project, my team worked with [Ariens](https://www.ariens.com/en-us) to develop a [navigation system for an industrial lawn mower](http://digitalcommons.olin.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=scope_2014).
