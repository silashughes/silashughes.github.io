I work directly with customers to help them make the most of the tools and services provided by a company for the customer's particular application. Currently, I work with [Markforged](https://markforged.com/), teaching with and helping their customers learn how to effectively design and 3D print continuous fiber reinforced parts and metal sintered parts using the [Mark X](https://markforged.com/mark-x/) and [Metal X](https://markforged.com/metal-x/).
