  &lt;p&gt;Maze without a Minotaur  &lt;br /&gt;
By Dana Gioia &lt;br /&gt;
If we could only push these walls &lt;br /&gt;
apart, unfold the room the way &lt;br /&gt;
a child might take apart a box &lt;br /&gt;
and lay it flat upon the floor— &lt;br /&gt;
so many corners cleared at last!   &lt;br /&gt;
Or else could rip away the roof &lt;br /&gt;
and stare down at the dirty rooms,   &lt;br /&gt;
the hallways turning on themselves,  &lt;br /&gt;
and understand at last their plan—&lt;br /&gt;
dark maze without a minotaur, &lt;br /&gt;
no monsters but ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;
Yet who &lt;br /&gt;
could bear to see it all? The slow &lt;br /&gt;
descending spirals of the dust &lt;br /&gt;
against the spotted windowpane, &lt;br /&gt;
the sunlight on the yellow lace,&lt;br /&gt;
the hoarded wine turned dark and sour,&lt;br /&gt;
the photographs, the letters—all &lt;br /&gt;
the crowded closets of the heart. &lt;br /&gt;
One wants to turn away—and cry &lt;br /&gt;
for fire to break out on the stairs  &lt;br /&gt;
and raze each suffocating room. &lt;br /&gt;
But the walls stay, the roof remains  &lt;br /&gt;
strong and immovable, and we &lt;br /&gt;
can only pray that if these rooms &lt;br /&gt;
have memories, they are not ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Halloween! This past week, my housemates and I built a maze/puzzle in our basement and invited some friends over to try it out. One by one, we led our guests to our basement entrance and closed the door behind them. In the pitch darkness, they had to find their way through passageways, sometimes climbing over obstacles or through tunnels. The final aspect of the maze was an interactive puzzle, which when solved, opened the way out. The puzzle, and in many respects the entire project, was inspired by was the poem above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a short video walkthrough of the maze. With the lights on, the maze is far from challenging, but it can provide some sense of what we made.&lt;/p&gt;
