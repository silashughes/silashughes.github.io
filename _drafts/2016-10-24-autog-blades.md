I've had a Durafly Auto-G remote controlled gyrocopter for a couple years now, but it's spent 99% of it's life in an unflyable condition. This is due in large part to how easy it is to break the top rotor blades. I have broken at least one (and often all three) rotor blade every time I have tried flying the autogyro.

So instead of buying another sackful of blades from Hobbyking, I decided to try 3D printing a set of blades. I measured the stock blades, modelled them in OnShape, and printed them on a Mark 2 printer on of a nylon/carbon-fiber blend called Onyx. The blades are printed hollow and in four pieces. The four pieces are then glued together to make a single blade.

And it flew! The printed blades were a couple grams heavier than the stock blades, but they got the autogyro airborne. Unfortunately, the vehicle did not stay airborne for very long.
