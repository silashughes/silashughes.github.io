# About Me

**My name is Silas Hughes and I design, build, and pilot robots.** I provide researchers and companies with tools, services and expertise to fully utilize robotic platforms in their work. I have an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from Olin College; since graduating in 2014, I have developed multiple custom drone platforms for researchers, pushed the limits of functional and composite 3D printing in vehicle and chassis design, and piloted drones for demonstrations and testing (i.e. safety piloting).
